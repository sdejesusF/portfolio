#Portfolio

Here you'll find some examples of my practices and knowledge in Android SDK like uses of ContentProvider, AsyncAdapter, Services, Activities, Fragments, UI elements such as ListView, CoordinationLayout, Toolbar, RelativeLayout, LinearLayout, NestedScrollView and much more, Android libraries like Design, Support, and AppCompar library. That's why the source code for this app is available on GitHub. Also, you'll see some others projects that I've worked not only with Android platform also for web and cross platform apps.

Is not adapted to tablets... yet.

In this app, I use some free vectors for the app icon and categories that are not mine, just with a few modification made by me, almost all are available in http://www.freepik.com, like http://www.freepik.com/free-vector/variety-of-document-icons_771097.htm
